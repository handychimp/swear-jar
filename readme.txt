A quick and dirty play around with Google voice recognition tools to make a popup appear every time the speaker swears. 

Was going to develop this to total up a bill for the swears during the session, and then allow the user to donate that much to a charity.

Setup:

1. Install Python 3.5 (or above)
2. Open command prompt and navigate to the folder you downloaded this too
3. Run command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
4. Run command "sudo gem install terminal-notifier"
5. After installation, run the script with "python swearjar.py"
6. Talk into the microphone, if a phrase contains a swear word, a notification will be received and tallied.
7. Exit the application by saying "Exit" or "Quit"


TO COME:
- Dealing with multiple swear words in a phrase
- Executable alternative to having to run python
